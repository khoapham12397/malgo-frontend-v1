# Live Site

### Installation

```
  git clone https://github.com/theksbd/bk-mathgorithm-client.git
```

Then type:

```
  npm install
```

to install all necessary packages for the project

### Run Client side

```
  npm run client
```

### [Optional] Access Client website across other devices

```
  npm run client:host
```

If you want to access the Client website on other devices (such as Mobile Phone, Tablet, other PC,...) to check the responsiveness, use the above command to public the Client side to the internet.

Then you can use the IP address which will be given in the console to access the website.

### [Optional] Run ESlint to lint/fix the code

```
  npm run lint
```

or

```
  npm run lint:fix
```

The first command will only check if there are any of wrong-looking codes then print them to the console, while the second one will not only check but also force the codes to be fixed for us.

### [Optional] Run Prettier to beautify the code

```
  npm run prettier
```

or

```
  npm run prettier:fix
```

The first command will only check if there are any of ugly formatted codes then print them to the console, while the second one will not only check but also force the codes to be styled for us.
